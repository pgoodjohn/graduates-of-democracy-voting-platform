# Graduates of Democracy Online Voting System
> Online system to determine the roles inside the organization Graduates Of Democracy.

This small web app has been created in order to proceed with the Graduates Of Democracy internal elections. The system has been built in a way such that only who has the email stored in the database and he/she has received a personal code that grants the access.

## Usage example

By changing a couple of functions and the names it is possible to adapt the system to work for any kind of election.

## Development setup

In order to work, a database must be set up according to the instructions given in the folder *sql*
By changing the config.php and making it point to the needed database it is possible to have the program work not in local mode.
  
## Release History

* 1.0.0
    * Initialized the repository for the web app.
